<h1>Our Menu</h1>
	<section class="k1 k2 k3">
		<div>
			<p class="head1">Chicken</p>
			<p class="cont">
			 Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="k1 k2 k3">
		<div>
			<p class="head2">Beef</p>
			<p class="cont">In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="k1 k4 k3">
	<div>
		<p class="head3">Sushi</p>
			<p class="cont">Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.)</p>
